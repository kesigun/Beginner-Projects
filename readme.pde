INSTRUCTIONS

Before you continue to read these instructions, please run the program but do not click on anything else yet.
Enjoying the music? Excellent. This game is a storytelling game, based on events that took place in the Lord of the Rings.
At the main menu, you must press SPACEBAR to start the game.
You will see a riddle. Hover the mouse over the buttons to see the choice of password. Choose one,
but the wrong one will result in your death. If you pick correctly, you will enter Moria.
You get to read a brief story on events that took place during the 4 days in Moria.
Then it moves to the finale, where you must tap 'A' in order to help break the bridge.
If you do not do so in time, you will lose the game.
If you beat it, you will come to the victory screen.

CODING QUALITY AND DESIGN

Creating a game like this required both creativity and coding skill, at first I thought it would be simple but I quickly
realized that I didn't just have to have the code working, I needed a good flow for the story as well. I feel like I managed
to do this in a succint way, while ensuring that no part of the code was overly complex. There were some cool parts that I'm
proud of, like the bar at the bridge fight which you have to tap a key for to try and fill it up. However, there were difficulties,
and I was unable to use the same methods that I had used for switching stages to force the game to return to the main menu after both the
victory and defeat screens. I am happy with this though, and I feel that anyone who enjoys the Lord of the Rings would appreciate this 
game as well. Hope you enjoyed it!
